A simple website skeleton using browser-sync. It's mainly for testing and playing with different frontend frameworks

I used browser-sync to run the stack, but you can just open the index.html file using your favorite browser. 

for browser-sync:

```
	$ browser-sync start --server --files "**/*.css, **/*.js, **/*.html"
```
